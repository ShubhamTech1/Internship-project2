2] Optimization of kit Item Distribution:

- **Description:** This project aims to enhance efficiency by optimizing the allocation of kit items based on factors such as demand, availability, and logistical constraints. The overarching goal is to minimize wastage, reduce distribution costs, and improve overall resource utilization. Additionally, the project seeks to enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring timely and accurate delivery of kit items while maintaining inventory levels within acceptable thresholds.
  
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model Building
  - **Model Deployment:** streamlit, flask

- **Objectives:**

  1. Improve efficiency by optimizing the allocation of kit items based on factors like demand, availability, and logistical constraints.
  2. Minimize wastage and reduce distribution costs by implementing effective allocation strategies for kit items.
  3. Enhance resource utilization by ensuring that kit items are distributed in a manner that maximizes their utility and minimizes excess inventory levels.
